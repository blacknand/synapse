# ðŸ§  Synapse

Synapse is a high-performance, multi-threaded, in-memory C++23 cache. It's engineered from the ground up for massive concurrency, providing a robust and low-latency solution for demanding applications. The architecture is built around modern C++ practices, focusing on scalability, thread safety, and performance that is not just claimed, but proven through rigorous benchmarking.

## Core Features

* **Massively Concurrent Hash Map**: Utilizes **sharded (striped) locking** to minimize lock contention, allowing for high-throughput access across multiple threads.
* **Advanced Concurrency Primitives**: Leverages `std::shared_mutex` to allow for concurrent reads, maximizing performance for read-heavy workloads.
* **Pluggable Eviction Policies**: Designed with a **strategy pattern** to easily switch between different cache eviction algorithms.
    * `LRUPolicy` (Least Recently Used) - *Planned*
    * `LFUPolicy` (Least Frequently Used) - *Planned*
* **Quantitative Benchmarking**: Integrated with **Google Benchmark** to provide concrete data on throughput, latency, and scalability under various thread counts.
* **Modern C++ Design**: Built with C++23 with a clean, modern API.
